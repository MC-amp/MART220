I was actually really surprised by what chatGPT did for this. My prompt was this: Create a portrait of chicken alfredo using simple shapes in p5.js.  You should create something with different shapes, colors and sizes. Which was exactly what the assignment said, except I told it to make specifically chicken alfredo. It was able to fill the lines for the pasta with it's color, rather than black, and it placed everything randomly every time which I didn't expect. It also added a green garnish of some kind. I decided to make it as simple as possible, and I didn't worry about putting things in functions because it is such a small amount of code. The end result of the 2 was wildly different, and chatGPT used several things that I didn't know about.
