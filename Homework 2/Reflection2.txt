For this assignment, I created 2 shapes that can be moved. One with wasd and one with the number pad. Everything is colored randomly, and circles fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. For ChatGPT, I copy and pasted the assignment exactly into it and it did something completely different. Instead of creating shapes that you can move, every time you press any key, it moves all the circles to a different random location. The code ChatGPT was really short and fairly simple, and so was what it created.
